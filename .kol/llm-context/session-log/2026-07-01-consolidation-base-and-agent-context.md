# Session: consolidation base established + agent-context scaffolded

**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Agent:** Grim (Claude Opus)
**Summary:** Set `kol-fxr` as the single consolidation target for the scattered editor prototypes, scaffolded it from the brand editor on the published DS, attempted (and reverted) a wholesale swap to kol-editor's Konva engine, restored the brand editor, and scaffolded the agent-context protocol.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified / Created
- **Whole directory — brand editor base.** Copied the frame compositor from `kol-monorepo/apps/brand` (`src/editor/` + a 15-file brand slice + `public/fonts`), `package.json` depending on the published `@kolkrabbi/kol-{theme,component,loader,framework}` as an external consumer, `vite.config.js`, `src/index.css` importing the DS. Renamed package to `kol-fxr`.
- **Agent-context protocol** (via `/init-agent-context`): `LLM_RULES.md`, `docs/llm-context/{README,ARCHITECTURE,AGENT-CONTEXT}.md`, `docs/{history,plan}.md`, `docs/_framework/`, `.claude/skills/{init-agent,log-work}/`, `.gitignore` block.
- **`docs/llm-context/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — filled with §1–§5 + non-goals (the real decisions below).
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — `allowBuilds: esbuild: true` (needed so `pnpm dev`/`build` don't trip pnpm 11's build-script gate).

### Reverted this session (not in final state)
- A **wholesale swap** of this directory to kol-editor's Konva/Pixi engine. It replaced the UI, not just functionality — reverted, brand editor restored from a scratch backup. Lesson captured in ARCHITECTURE §4.

## Current State

### Working
- **Brand editor restored and building clean** (`pnpm build` green). Renders with its full chrome: Mode / File / Canvas / Templates top bar, Stroke/Colour/Swatches, palette panel (Pool/Mode/swatches/Randomize/Reset), Layers/Assets, canvas.
- Installs + boots as a real external consumer of the **published DS** (`@kolkrabbi/kol-* 0.1.1`), 0 console errors.
- Agent-context protocol live (`/init-agent`, `/log-work` wired).

### Known Issues
- **Not a git repo yet** — no version-control safety net (this is why destructive changes have felt risky; recommend `git init` + an initial commit).
- **Palette swatches all resolve to `cream-500 / #FAFAFA`** — the published `kol-brand-color.css` brand tokens may not be resolving, or it's the un-randomized initial state (hitting Randomize would tell).
- **28 `chevron-down` icon-not-found warnings** from the published `@kolkrabbi/kol-loader` — icon missing/renamed in the published registry.
- `opentype.js` pinned to deprecated `1.3.5`; single ~7 MB JS chunk (build warning only).

## Next Steps
1. **Decide the engine path (OPEN):** adopt kol-editor's Konva engine via re-skin (keep this look, per ARCHITECTURE §4), or grow shape-editing on the current DOM/SVG base. This gates everything downstream.
2. **Shape-editor parity work** (from the kol-editor audit — these are the real gaps): **node/bezier editing** (currently anchor-drag scaffold, no handles), **flatten** (absent), **export settings** (functions exist, no UI). Canvas/layers/boolean/background already work in kol-editor.
3. `git init` + initial commit for a real safety net.
4. Fill `history.md`; flesh out `AGENT-CONTEXT.md` as state solidifies.
