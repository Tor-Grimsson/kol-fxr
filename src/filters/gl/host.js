/**
 * GL filter host — the ONLY module that imports the three.js filter engines
 * (synths / distortion / lens). Loaded lazily by EngineFilterLayer, mirroring
 * loops/gl/host.js, so three stays out of the base bundle.
 *
 * Contract (driven by the renderer):
 *   createEngine(def, canvas)            → engine mounted on the layer canvas
 *   setSource(def, engine, srcCanvas)    → push the fitted source image
 *   applyParams(def, engine, params)     → flat layer params → engine
 *   driveEngine(def, engine, {u, dt})    → one frame (synths are feedback-
 *                                          based → dt drive, free-running)
 *   destroyEngine(engine)                → teardown
 *
 * Every ported engine shares the same surface (setSource / setParams /
 * frame / resize / dispose — the synthBase contract), so only construction
 * switches on the def.
