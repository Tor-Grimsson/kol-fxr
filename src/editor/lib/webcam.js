/**
 * webcam — live-camera MediaStream registry for photo layers with
 * `srcType: 'webcam'`.
 *
 * A MediaStream is neither JSON-serializable nor history/draft-safe, so it
 * can't live on the layer. The layer only carries `srcType: 'webcam'` (and no
 * `src`); the actual stream is held here, keyed by the layer's id. LayerRenderer
 * reads it (ensureWebcam / getWebcamStream) to attach as a `<video>` srcObject,
 * and stops the tracks (stopWebcam) on layer delete / source change / unmount.
 *
 * `ensureWebcam` dedupes concurrent requests (the source button's user-gesture
 * request and LayerRenderer's mount effect race otherwise, double-prompting):
 * the in-flight promise is cached until it resolves. Framework-free, browser-
 * native getUserMedia — no deps, matching the editor's audio-input model.
