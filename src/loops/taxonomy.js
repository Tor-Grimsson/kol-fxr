/* The app hierarchy over the flat loop registry GROUPS, labs-true:
 *
 *   METHOD > TYPE > CATEGORY > PRESET
 *
 * (documented in docs/documentation/01-hierarchy.md). This file carries the
 * GENERATIVE method's TYPES as pure data: type → registry group ids, in
 * labs sidebar order. The registry stayed flat as families were imported
 * one by one; this restores the levels without touching it.
 *
 * Multi-group types mirror labs' own internal groups: labs Loops =
 * Shape/Field/Pattern (editor: Simple/Field/Pattern Loops); labs 3D Scene
 * spans the primitive/ribbon/forms/environments sub-pages plus Abstract
 * (RD/MSTP), which the editor registered as its own group.
 *
 * NOT here by design: `optic` (labs parks those four generator pages under
 * EFFECTS > Pattern — see effectCategories.js/MenuTop) and `paratype`
 * (labs Type Lab section — parked below the Generative menu).
